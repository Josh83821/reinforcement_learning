Personal project attempting to implement reinforcement learning techniques locally and then run then against gymnasium environments found at https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/.

"models" folder houses the different implemented model architectures and likewise "algorithms" stores the algorithms.
"module_testing.ipynb" is where I've actually run the code most recently.
